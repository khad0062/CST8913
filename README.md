The Case Study that I have chosen is  eClinicalWorks thrives in the cloud with Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Disk Storage.

eClinicalWorks works in managing the electronic health records, population health data, patient records data in cloud-based solutions. But while managing such large amounts of data with more customer subscribing their businesses, it must invest more on infrastructure like hardware and large data storage along with IT professionals to manage such infrastructure. To avoid such overhead issues, eClinicalWorks shifted their customers to Microsoft Azure public cloud so that their e-cloud health services is capable of 24/7 availability, robust system with more stability and scalability based on their traffic to their business system. 


Based on the case study, I will ask the following questions about to know more about the company infrastructure.
1.	Which cloud platform the company where using or it was co-location hosting model?
2.	What type of security model they were implementing to protect the customer’s data?
3.	What is the system uptime ratio of their system?
4.	Was their cloud hosting model compliance with the business model?


Certainly, here's a simplified RACI matrix for the migration stakeholders:				
				
Task	Migration Team	Data Owners	App Team	Project Manager
Project planning	R	C	C	A
Data extraction	R	A	I	I
Data transformation	R	C	C	I
Migration execution	R	C	C	A
Data validation	R	A	R	I

Since the company have colocation hosting model where they have large amounts data of EHR platform, they can use the lift and shift migration. They can transfer the existing the coexisting applications to cloud platforms. Company has to plan the computing power, security, storage, network resources and other computing resources so that applications can run with full availability, scalability before shifting to cloud platforms.  This migration gives the same architecture previously the applications were running.

Here’s a high-level schedule for eClinicalWorks' migration process: 
•	Establish goal and requirement of migrate.
•	 Finalizing applications and data to be migrate.
•	Setup of computing resources in cloud platforms.
•	Establishing the business compliance with the cloud platform security.
•	Transfer the application and data with the Cloud platform support team.
•	Perform performance, functionality, and security testing and address issues and optimize configurations.
•	Regressive analyses of application performance in that platform.  

The chosen cloud platform company should be able to handle the growing data and customer’s of eClinicalWorks. The cloud solution should be complaint with the HIPPA act along with the ability to scale along with robustness of the cloud security. It should be able to integrate the complex application architecture from the existing infrastructure. It should reduce the operational cost the infrastructure than the colocation infrastructure.
