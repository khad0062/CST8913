On-premises solution design includes:
1. Physical host or server: It consists of the web application hosted and its installation files, libraries, and files with load balancers.
2. Networking: Routers to connect the internet, and access the web applications, servers, and email service. A firewall is  used to protect against malicious attacks.
3. File storage: Local File system to store documents, images, and videos for products.
4. Email Services: On-premises mail server (e.g., Postfix) for client notifications.
5. Blackened database: Use of dedicated hardware for Microsoft SQL server.
