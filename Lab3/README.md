## Section1: On-premises solution Design

![On-permises Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1f9621-ae0d-45f3-a827-1d41044bb7ed)

On-premises solution design includes:
1. Physical host or server: It consists of the web application hosted and its installation files, libraries, and files with load balancers.
2. Networking: Routers to connect the internet, and access the web applications, servers, and email service. A firewall is  used to protect against malicious attacks.
3. File storage: Local File system to store documents, images, and videos for products.
4. Email Services: On-premises mail server (e.g., Postfix) for client notifications.
5. Blackened database: Use of dedicated hardware for Microsoft SQL server.

Dependencies:
Web application connects database with SQL server to store, manage, and retrieve the data.
Networking helps to connect and secure all the components in the on-premises architecture.
Web app connects to email service for order confirmations through API.
