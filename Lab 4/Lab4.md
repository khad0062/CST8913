## Target Architecture
To ensure high availability and minimize downtime, the solution implements:

1. Redundancy: Each region hosts a replicated instance of WebServerVM and SQLVM.

2. Load Balancing: A global load balancer directs traffic to the healthiest region.

3. Failover Mechanism:

   If the primary region fails, traffic is redirected to the secondary region.

    SQLVM uses database replication with automatic failover to maintain consistency.

     DNS services are configured to quickly update regional failover.


## Migration Steps
1.	Replication of Virtual Machines Across Regions

•	Deploy WebServerVM and SQLVM in the primary region.
•	Use infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, ARM templates) to replicate VMs in the secondary region.
•	Configure auto-scaling to handle traffic changes dynamically.

2.	Configuration of Load Balancer

•	Deploy a global load balancer to distribute traffic between primary and secondary regions.
•	Implement health checks to monitor WebServerVM instances.
•	Set up region priority rules to direct traffic to the primary region unless it fails.

3.	Implementation of Database Replication and Failover

•	Use SQL replication strategies (e.g., Geo-Replication or Always On Availability Groups).
•	Configure automatic failover to the secondary region.
•	Implement backup and disaster recovery policies to prevent data loss.
