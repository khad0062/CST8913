# Tagging Strategy for Azure Resources

## Introduction
In Azure, tags are key-value pairs that can be applied to resources to help organize, manage, and track them. They are useful for categorizing resources based on criteria such as environment, department, or project.

## Tagging Strategy
For this project, the following tags are used:

- **Environment**: Indicates the deployment environment of the resource.  
  - **Value**: `Test` (for resources in the test environment).
- **Department**: Specifies the department responsible for the resource.  
  - **Value**: `IT` (for resources managed by the IT department).

## Application of Tags
These tags should be applied to all resources within the scope of this project, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases. Tags can be added during resource creation or updated later using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.

## Benefits
Using these tags offers several advantages:
- **Organization**: Easily identify and group resources by environment and department.
- **Cost Management**: Track and allocate costs to specific departments or environments.
- **Automation**: Enable automation tasks (e.g., starting/stopping resources) based on their environment.

## Best Practices
- **Consistency**: Apply tags uniformly across all resources.
- **Mandatory Tags**: Require key tags like `Environment` and `Department` for all resources.
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive and meaningful tag names and values.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update tags to reflect changes in resource usage or ownership.

## Applying Tags
Tags can be applied using various methods:
- **Azure Portal**: Go to the resource, select "Tags," and input the key-value pairs.
- **Azure CLI**: Use the `az resource tag` command.
- **Azure PowerShell**: Use the `Update-AzTag` cmdlet.
